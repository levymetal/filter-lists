# levymetal's filter lists

Filter lists designed for [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) but should also work with [AdGuard](https://adguard.com) or any blocker that supports EasyList-compatible filters. A guide for importing lists into uBlock Origin can be found [here](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-lists-from-around-the-web).
